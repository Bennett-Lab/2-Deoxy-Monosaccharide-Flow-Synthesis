### Getting Started

#### Automatic (MacOS/Linux)

Run `./setup` in order to install all binaries needed and python libraries for MacOS

#### Manual (Windows)

1. [Download Python 3](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows)

Note that you do not have to do the optional steps

2. Verify that python3 is installed properly by running `py -m pip --version` in the powershell application

If that didn't work, try to manually download it by running these commands one after the other:
- `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py`
- `py get-pip.py`

3. Download mechwolf by running `py pip install mechwolf`

4. Download jupyter notebook by running `py pip install notebook`

*In the future, we plan to make an automatic script for Windows as well*
